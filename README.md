# Car Crossing Game

## Description
#### This program focuses on the correct use of pointers and 2D arrays in order to simulate a "live" dynamic game displayed in the terminal.
#### It involves a player object and multiple car objects that the player must avoid when crossing from one side of the map to the "Goal" displayed on the other side of the map

#### Valgrind was introduced in this project to detect memory access errors or memory leaks

### The most difficult components I encountered involved designing the program in a way that code could be reused as much as possible

## How to Run the Program
#### To compile the program enter make
#### Run the program by entering "./main.c <arg1> <arg2>" where arg1 and arg2 are integers stating the dimensions of the map of the game
#### Use WASD keys to move the player and work your way towards the "G" representing the end goal.
#### Game will be over if a car hits the player or player reaches the "G"
